*Fixed a show stopper bug where that occurred when running the program on an
existing .srt(subtitle) file that does not exactly match the media files
name resulting in the playing of inappropriate audio.  This bug occurs for any
subtitle downloaded from opensubtitles.org.  E.g. MovieName.mkv has a subtitle
file MovieName.en.srt.  The app was inappropriately creating the edl filename
based upon the srt file rather than the movie file name.  XBMC only loads .edl
files when they match the movie files format. Running the app on MovieName.mkv
with a subtitle file named MovieName.en.srt now appropriately creates
MovieName.edl and audio is muted correctly.
